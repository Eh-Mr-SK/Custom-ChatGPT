# ChatGPT- Custom ChatGPT Q&A system 
## Getting Started
ChatGPT is a web-based chatbot application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate natural language responses to user inputs. The application was developed using React, Express, and Node.js, and the OpenAI API was accessed using the `@openai/ai-engine` package.

The application features a clean and modern user interface, and allows users to chat with the chatbot in real time. The GPT-3 model used in the application is the text-davinci-003 model, which is one of the most advanced language models currently available, and is capable of generating human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts.

ChatGPT is designed to be easily deployable, and can be run on any system that supports Node.js and the OpenAI API. It can also be customized to fit specific use cases and domains, making it a powerful tool for developers and businesses looking to incorporate natural language processing into their applications.

## File structure
#### `client` - Holds the client application
- #### `public` - This holds all of our static files
- #### `src`
    - #### `assets` - This folder holds assets such as images, docs, and fonts
    - #### `components` - This folder holds all of the different components that will make up our views
    - #### `views` - These represent a unique page on the website i.e. Home or About. These are still normal react components.
    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of our browser routes and different views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `server` - Holds the server application
- #### `config` - This holds our configuration files, like mongoDB uri
- #### `controllers` - These hold all of the callback functions that each route will call
- #### `models` - This holds all of our data models
- #### `routes` - This holds all of our HTTP to URL path associations for each unique url
- #### `tests` - This holds all of our server tests that we have defined
- #### `server.js` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors like the scripts defined in the next section of the README
#### `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore
#### `README` - This file!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run-script dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run-script client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>
